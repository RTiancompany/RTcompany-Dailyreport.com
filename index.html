  <p>The Supreme Guiding Principle: No member of Starfleet shall interferewith the life and cultural development of <br>
    an alien race that is sentient and inhabiting an environment with normal cultural  development and the ability to think<br> about
     itself, including the introduction of advanced  knowledge, power, and technology into a world that is incapable <br>of advanced
      intelligence to control its development. Starfleet members may not violate these Terms for the purpose <br>
      of saving their own lives or ships, except for the correction of other violations of these Terms or the handling of <br>
      accidental contamination without informing the alien world. Starfleet members shallgive the   highestpriority to these
    <br> Terms and Conditions and shall bear the highest psychological responsibility when performing their missions.
